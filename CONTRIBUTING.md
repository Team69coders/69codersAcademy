## How to Contribute ü§î

- Look at the existing [**Issues**](https://github.com/Team69coders/69codersAcademy/issues) or [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/Team69coders/69codersAcademy/issues/new)!
- [**Fork the Repo**](https://github.com/Team69coders/69codersAcademy/fork). Then, create a branch for any issue that you are working on. Finally, commit your work.
- Create a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/Team69coders/69codersAcademy/compare)** (_PR_), which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.
- Add screenshots or screen captures to your Pull Request to help us understand the effects of the changes proposed in your PR.

## Making Pull Requests

1. When you submit a pull request and If your pull request has merge conflicts with the `main` branch (GitHub checks for this automatically and notifies you), you are responsible for resolving them. You can do this by merging the `main` branch into your branch (`git pull upstream main`), and then pushing the updated branch to your fork (`git push`). If you don't know how to resolve the underlying issue(s), you can ask for help.

2. Each pull request should contain a single logical change or related set of changes that make sense to submit together. If a pull request becomes too large or contains too many unrelated changes, it becomes too difficult to review. In such cases, the reviewer has the right to close your pull request and ask that you submit a separate pull request for each logical set of changes that belong together.
3. Link the issue you have resolved in the Pull Request Template (e.g Closes/Fixes #99).
4. Use [Conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your changes.
5. Do not re-open a pull request that a reviewer has closed.
   - Make sure to tick the "Allow edits from maintainers" box. This allows us to directly make minor edits / refactors and saves a lot of time.
